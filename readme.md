# Dynamical Dirichlet Mixture Model

In this repo, we share the source codes written in Matlab back in 2007 and the corresponding report from the public [official link](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146114/files/) to Github with the
hope that this model could find more applications.

* For technical details, please refer the technical report:

* Please refer [contents.m](./source_codes/contents.m) for a brief overview of the codes.
* For the impatient, run [Script_Test_EstHMMDM.m](./source_codes/Script_Test_EstHMMDM.m) directly to have a flavor.
* Any comments and suggestions are extremely welcome.
